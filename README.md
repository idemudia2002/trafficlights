# Kit
**arduino**, **diod**, **breadboard**.

-------

After I coded mÂ´for my traffic ligts i got ispiration from racing formel 1. So I decided to make sounds that will sync with the delay of the traffic lights and for that I used a **buzzer** 

I managed to make a succesful code for a buzzer. I haven't used the code together with the arduino yet.

--------

# Function
The code will control three leds (red, yellow, green) to simulate racing lights used to start a formel 1 race. The leds are controlled by a timer. To make this simulation more authentic there is also a audio signal, consisting of a [buzzer](https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/SURYATEJA/use-a-buzzer-module-piezo-speaker-using-arduino-uno-89df45) controlled with different frequences.
